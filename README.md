# XP CRUSH GAME
The XP crush game was inspired by the candy crush game available for mobile devices.
Its main idea is to interact with the board to arrange the same icons in columns or rows.
The application uses graphics and sounds associated with the iconic Windows XP system.
It is based on using and manipulating the state of a React component.
